= Overview

This is an implementation of proposed WG21 (ISO C++) features:

* `std::breakpoint' (link:https://wg21.link/P2514[P2514]) Causes a debugger to
  stop at the point of the call.
* `std::is_debugger_present` (link:https://wg21.link/P2514[P2514]) Indicates if
  the program is running in a debugger.

This is based on Isabela Muerte's
link:https://github.com/bruxisma/breakpoint[implementation] of
link:https://wg21.link/p1279[P1279].
